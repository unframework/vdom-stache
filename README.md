# Stupid Template Tricks: DIY React Using Mustache

Fancy using new [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-[style](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) virtual DOM techniques but unwilling to part ways with the minimalism of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)?

Why not build your own React, using vanilla [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) and [duct tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_tape)!

And yes, this technique has been deployed to production (in a different codebase, circa 2013, at a past gig).

## Sample Code

    npm install -g beefy
    npm install
    beefy index.js # ... then visit http://localhost:9966
